Good initiative by hospital 
It was a surprise to learn about a library functioning on Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai thorugh your report, It will be a solace for patients, caregivers and visitors. Awareness of its existence is all that is needed to attract more readers. Reading books and periodicals during hard times will indeed soothe the mind and provide welcome distraction to chaotic thoughts. One can get transported to a tranquil place. Lending books will indeed help the hospital staff to get relief from their work stress.

Recurrent power cuts 
Unannounced power cuts have become recurrent In Ramanathapuram town. These power shutdowns, in the name of maintenance cause much hardships to the residents. The Tangedco can announce the power shutdown at elast two days in advance so that people can prepare themselves. In foreign countries, there are no shutdowns; instead, they change over from one grid to another within fraction of a second and ensure uninterrupted power supply. When rockets reach moon the with help of advanced scientific technology, canâ€™t we ensure continuous power supply?
