Before the G20 summit in New Delhi began, there was, as Shakespeare put it, a tide in the affairs of men. The global order lay fractured. Divided by the Ukraine War. Split over how to tackle the adverse impact of climate change. Torn asunder by a pandemic that ravaged lives and economies. Disunited on how to conduct world trade. Bisected by the tech haves and have-nots. Dissected into income groups and development indices. The cleavages were deep and glaringly stark. But amidst all this gloom and doom, the most powerful grouping of world leaders had a choice. To paraphrase the Bard, taken at the flood, it could pull the world towards harmony, healing, hope and prosperity. If not, then with the Russian president Vladimir Putin and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping deciding to skip the summit, the Indian presidency of the G20 would have faced the grave prospect of omitting a consensus declaration from the leaders. That would have signalled a failure and cheered India’s detractors but led to greater global strife and misery.
It would be India’s moment, though, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi interrupted the proceedings of the G20 to announce dramatically that the New Delhi Declaration had the approval of its members. Banging down the gavel decisively, he declared that it had been adopted, to cheers not just from Team India that had worked hard to achieve it but also the assembled world leaders. If there was ever a turning point in recent history, then the one witnessed in the Bharat Mandapam on the afternoon of September 9, 2023 would be among the top contenders. For over 100 nations (including the African Union that was admitted to the G20 earlier that morning, thanks to India’s persistence) that accounted for three-fourths of the world’s GDP demonstrated they could sink their enormous differences and together work for the “global public good”.
This was truly a ‘woke’ G20. Everyone agreed that war, including the one in Ukraine, caused “immense human suffering” and must be ended, as the New Delhi Declaration stated, but there were many more pressing concerns, including tackling global recession, lifting millions of people who had slipped below the poverty line after Covid’s devastating impact apart from arresting the alarming and relentless march of climate change that was threatening humanity’s very existence. Indian negotiators and their allies hammered home the point that the consequences of even a year of continuing anarchy and vacillation resulting from a lack of consensus in the G20 would be akin to the outbreak of World War 3. Amitabh Kant, India’s Sherpa for the G20, who led the negotiations, said, “We told the members that instead of the warpath, the G20 should focus on the economic growth path, which was why it was formed in the first place. It cannot be preoccupied with the Ukraine war and bring the world to a standstill. Now 80 per cent of the global growth was coming from the emerging economies, including India, and six of the 12 fastest-growing economies in the world are in the Global South. So the G20 must prioritise their concerns.” But the consensus on Ukraine came about primarily because of PM Modi’s personal interactions with key G20 leaders not just in Delhi but also when he attended the BRICS summit in Johannesburg and the East Asia meet in Jakarta just prior to the Delhi summit.
The Delhi Declaration was a win-win for India and the world for several reasons. For one, by admitting the African Union, which has 55 members, it made G20 far more inclusive, apart from acknowledging the growing salience of developing countries. Here too, much of the credit should go to PM Modi, who led from the front. Xi must have regretted not attending because Modi emerged as the unchallenged voice of the Global South. Another feather in the cap came from the Green Pact to tackle the threat of climate change. Instead of just 100 billion dollars that the developed world had committed annually under the Paris Climate Change agreement, the G20 pushed for a more realistic $6 trillion by 2030 to keep global temperatures below danger levels. An action plan to accelerate the progress in implementing the sustainable development goals (SDGs) was chalked out. A road map for the much-needed revamp of Multinational Development Banks (MDB) like the World Bank also met approval and a Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) was set, which pushed the banks’ lending headroom to $200 billion.
As important was that the G20 brought Digital Public Infrastructure or DPI as an integral part of financial inclusion. India’s achievements on this front were lauded and an action plan for DPI implementation in developing countries in the next four years was approved. Apart from gender empowerment, the New Delhi G20 summit also pushed for a more balanced and regulated approach towards dealing with cryptocurrency (see graphic India G20: The Big Breakthroughs). The Indian G20 resulted in 73 action-oriented outcomes, double the number under the Indonesian presidency in 2022 or the Italian helmsmanship the year before. “Prime Minister Modi was clear that India’s G20 presidency should result in actionable outcomes and that India should leave a lasting legacy, particularly for the development of the Global South,” says Dr Pramod K. Mishra, principal secretary to the prime minister.

Led by the PMO, review meetings have been called for all the respective ministries involved in dealing with the outcomes. The prime minister has also called for a virtual summit of G20 leaders in November to review the progress made before India hands over the presidency to Brazil for 2024. That will be the toughest part. The G20 functions more like a club of nations than an executive organisation. It is a normative body with probably the biggest achievement coming only way back in 2008 when it moved to sort out the global financial meltdown caused by the collapse of the Lehman Brothers. It was around this time that it was elevated from a financial ministers’ meet to the heads of government level to make it more decisive. Earlier G20 meetings were dominated by the agenda set by the G7 grouping of powerful nations. But India during its presidency, along with other emerging nations such as Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia, worked in tandem to give the G20 a development agenda that reflected the aspirations of the Global South.
Syed Akbaruddin, India’s former permanent representative to the UN, says, “If the Western countries led by the US agreed to a less aggressive formulation of the Ukraine war than that of Bali by not naming and shaming Russia directly, it was because they realised they would undermine India’s stature if there was no Delhi Declaration. Also, it could end up giving the upper hand to China, which had expanded the BRICS and SCO grouping to counter the West. So, the Western nations found a technical fix to the language in the declaration and decided they would live to fight another day or in another forum.” Akbaruddin points out that the G20 is not structured to be an implementation body and India would have to travel considerable distance to have the agenda set in New Delhi put into action.
Expectedly, Ukraine expressed its deep disappointment with what it perceived as Russia having its way and the West capitulating to Indian pressure to reach a consensus. British prime minister Rishi Sunak faced criticism from Opposition MPs for allowing a “weakened” statement on Ukraine as did some other Western leaders when they returned home. French president Emmanuel Macron defensively pointed out that the G20 was not primarily meant to sort out geopolitical issues. Many experts said that the G20 has dropped several notches in status by downplaying geopolitical issues. John Bolton, a former US national security adviser, called for G20 to be disbanded altogether. Writing in the Washington Post, Bolton argued, “Mountains of final communiques, joint statements and outcome documents have contributed to global deforestation and nothing else.” Bolton cryptically observed that the Delhi Declaration contained only “an anodyne comment on Russia’s unprovoked aggression, even weaker than its 2022 (Bali) statement”.
Kant denies the charge and asserts that the New Delhi Declaration was a hard-fought consensus that not only reiterated what Bali said but was much stronger with a clear message to Russia and other countries to not transgress on territorial sovereignty. Kant says, “What we achieved is moderating the geopolitical voice. We cooled down temperatures and pushed for a diplomatic settlement to the Ukraine War.” A host of foreign policy experts agree that India’s G20 presidency was an unqualified success. Not only because of the excellent logistics and arrangements made for the summit, which the PMO headed by Mishra oversaw, but also because India steered the G20 away from being derailed on the Ukraine issue and the great power games over it. D.B. Venkatesh Varma, a former Indian ambassador to Russia, points out, “Both in symbolism and in substance, the Delhi G20 is a spectacular success for India and Prime Minister Modi. At a time when there was intense flux in the international system, India succeeded in hammering out a consensus on a range of major global issues. It was a power test that India passed with flying colours, which has put the country in the top league, and all this on its own strength. The G20 has been transformed to reflect the aspirations of the Global South and India has taken on the mantle of that leadership.” Varma points out that this is both an opportunity and a challenge for India to keep up not only the convergence that it has achieved but its ability to withstand the pressure from great powers as was demonstrated during the G20. For that, Indian diplomacy will be severely tested in the coming years. As S. Jaishankar, the minister for external affairs, put it, “The G20 has contributed to making India world-ready and the world India-ready.”
What the Delhi G20 has also done is to set in motion a new and evolving global order. The past decade saw global disorder peak and a breakdown of the Washington consensus for free markets, privatisation and globalisation. Today, the world is beset with such issues as deglobalisation, American withdrawal, growing protectionism, a hostile China and wars over trade, technology, terror and Ukraine. Nations are realising that this dangerous instability in international affairs has to be moderated.
Meanwhile, China has emerged as a major global major power and is challenging the hegemony of the US. The Ukraine war and the Covid pandemic has seen the rise of a multipolar world, with America still all-powerful but China using its rapid economic growth to expand its influence across continents. While China remains a regional military power, economically, it has become a superpower and challenged American dominance. The US has worked towards tying up a host of groupings that could contain China, with India being an integral part of the plan. US President Joe Biden has invested enormous political capital by hosting PM Modi in June, including selling hi-tech military-ware that it doesn’t offer even to some of its closest allies. Even at the G20 summit, the two held a bilateral and Biden was all praise for Modi’s leadership.
India itself has the task of playing a trapeze artist on the international stage. To do so, even while moving closer to the US to counter the Chinese challenge, India has maintained relations with Russia. It has also succeeded in engaging West Asia, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as demonstrated by the signing of the groundbreaking India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor for economic integration on the sidelines of the summit. By succeeding in getting the African Union into the G20, India has burnished its image of being a leader of the Global South. On foreign policy, the Modi government played its cards well despite suffering serious setbacks in its relations with China. Addressing the B20 leaders’ summit, Jaishankar pointed out that the reason for the sharp focus on the Global South is that these societies are under exceptional stress, especially after the Covid pandemic. It had seriously damaged their economies and disrupted trade, all of which was exacerbated by the fuel and fertiliser shortages caused by the Ukraine war. Jaishankar warned, “If unaddressed, it will become a serious drag on the global economy. Do consider what the implications are for all of us—North or South—of a slowdown in nutrition, health, education, employment or even security. And indeed, when the promise of digitisation, connectivity and technology falls short.”
The Delhi G20 summit saw India coalescing the Global South’s efforts to bring the issues that matter the most to them to the forefront. Varma says, “The content and the manner in which global public good is being taken forward increasingly has the imprimatur of the Global South and India has played a major role in that. There is a G20 before Delhi and there is a G20 after Delhi.” Akbaruddin agrees. “It’s the Lilliputians that are now tying up Gulliver and getting him to deal with their issues first.” Kant has a point when he says, “What India has done with the G20 is bring multilateralism to the centre stage,” he says. It’s too early to say how the emerging world order will shape up, but what India has done is succeeded in uniting them in pursuit of the global public good. In the long run, that is a greater binding force than power and pelf.
