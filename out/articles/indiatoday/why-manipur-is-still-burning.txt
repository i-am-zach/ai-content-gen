Over the past month and a half, Manipur has been seized by repeated cycles of violence, bloodletting and failed efforts at peace. Since May 3, when ethnic clashes first erupted in the northeastern state, 130 people have died, 352 have been injured and some 60,000 have had to flee their homes. The list under ‘still counting’...over 4,300 incidents of arson, nearly 3,500 houses destroyed in around 275 villages, 4,000 firearms looted by violent mobs from police armouries. All this despite Manipur being under a heavy security blanket—the state has India’s third-highest number of police personnel per 100,000 people; large parts of it are under the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), with 114 companies of various central forces deployed. To top it all, a ‘double engine’ regime—BJP governments at the Centre and the state—is in power. ‘Triple engine’ if you count the not-inconsiderable presence of one of the party’s strongest leaders as a chief minister in the neighbourhood. And the Union home ministry (MHA) is constantly monitoring the situation.
So why is Manipur still burning? Because the entire state—from the administration to civil society—is ethnically split between the two warring communities, Meitei and Kuki, with a strong whiff of a tense religious binary overlaid on it. At every level, ethnic loyalties, in what has been a battle for land and existence, look to be preceding professional integrity within the administration. For instance, on May 4, when arms were looted from a police training centre and the camp of the 7th Manipur Rifles and 6th India Reserve battalion of Manipur police, all located in Pangei, a Meitei-dominated area in Imphal valley, similar scenes were witnessed in police stations and training centres in Churachandpur, a Kuki-majority district that very day. In either case, as multiple reports suggest, police gua­rds—mostly Meiteis in Pangei and Kukis in Churachandpur—voluntarily facilitated the loot so that their respective communities could arm themselves against aggressors. “A Meitei friend of mine, who is a senior cop in Churachandpur, could not intervene when mobs looting arms were helped by Kuki policemen,” says Prof. Bhagat Oinam of Jawaharlal Nehru University. “Besides, the mobs easily outnumbered the police personnel on most occasions.” That the lines between the protectors and perpetrators were blurred was proven by CCTV footage from June 13 of a group wearing Rapid Action Force (RAF) uniforms and wielding shields and weapons vandalising cars in Imphal West.
The allegations of bias run from the lower constabulary to the top cop of the state and to the political leadership. To instil a sense of balance, Director General of Police (DGP) P. Doungel, a Kuki, was replaced with Rajiv Singh, an IPS officer of the Tripura cadre, but it hasn’t helped. Ten Kuki MLAs, including seven from the ruling BJP, are demanding a separate administration for Kukis. One of them, Paolienlal Haokip, the BJP legislator from Saikot, has openly accused chief minister N. Biren Singh of siding with the Meiteis. The MHA has now appointed former NIA and CRPF DIG Kuldeep Singh as advisor to the CM.
Even the armed forces have not escaped blame. Several Meitei groups claimed the paramilitary force Assam Rifles and the central government were soft on Kuki militant groups subject to the 2008 Suspension of Operation (SoO) agreement. They say these groups led the attacks against the Meiteis. What has lent credence to this charge is a PIL filed in an NIA court on June 8 by S.S. Haokip, chairman of the United Kuki Liberation Front (UKLF), one of the armed outfits under the SoO. It included a 2019 letter written by Haokip to Union home minister Amit Shah. In it, Haokip claimed that the UKLF and another Kuki group, the United Peoples’ Front (UPF), had helped BJP candidates win in the assembly election, as per an agreement with Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma and former BJP in-charge of the Northeast, Ram Madhav. They also helped the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, claimed the letter. In the 2022 assembly polls, the Kuki National Organisation (KNO), an umbrella group of 17 insurgent groups, and UPF, representing eight other Kuki outfits, had publicly extended support to BJP candidates in Kuki areas.
The revelations have naturally fuelled conspiracy theories. If Kuki groups claim that Biren Singh took over 24 hours to issue shoot-at-sight orders after Meitei-fuelled violence erupted on May 3, the Union government has been accused of dithering on revoking the SoO agreement with Kuki groups because of previous political support.

On March 10, the state government unilaterally withdrew the SoO agreement with two groups—Kuki National Army (KNA) and Zomi Revolutionary Army (ZRA)—alleging they were instigating people against its drive to evict illegal encroachers from forest lands. Sources say they have also been arming Kuki villagers. On May 25, 12 Meitei BJP legislators from Manipur met Shah in Guwahati and claimed they were under pressure to resign as the community felt betrayed because of non-action against SoO groups. During his three-day visit (May 29-June 1), Shah warned Kuki militant groups of stern action if the SoO terms were violated. On June 12, the CM promised action against “some splinter terrorist groups”, alluding to Kuki outfits. But the latest incident in Kangpokpi district in the wee hours of June 14 showed how fraught things still are—villagers made a retaliatory attack on suspected militants holed up in a church, exacting the highest single toll yet of nine dead.
Kuki victims, meanwhile, say they are being targeted by two radical Meitei outfits—Arambai Tenggol and Meitei Leepun. They allege the vigilante groups enjoy the patronage of Meitei politicians of the BJP, including Biren Singh. In fact, Manipur’s sole Rajya Sabha member and titular king, Leishemba Sanajaoba, is a founder of Arambai Tenggol. The group not only rejected the allegations but on May 26 temporarily dissolved itself. Meitei Leepun president Pramot Singh, though, has no such qualms. In a Facebook post on April 28, he appealed to his followers to “annihilate our traditional rivals in the hills”. “The violence has continued because Meitei groups backed by the state government want to obliterate us,” says Seilen Haokip, spokesperson of the KNO.

While rivalry between the valley-dwelling Meiteis and Kukis in the hills has a long history, the immediate trigger was an April 14 high court order—the first acts of violence erupted in a solidarity march opposing it. The court had directed the state to send a recommendation to the Centre to include Meiteis in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list. The Meitei demand for ST status and the tribals’ opposition to it is explained by geography and demographics. Broadly, the state is divided into the Imphal valley and the hill areas. Of Manipur’s 60 assembly seats, 40 are in the valley, which has six districts—Imphal East, Imphal West, Thoubal, Bishnupur, Kakching and Kangpokpi. The remaining 20 seats are spread over 10 districts. The valley districts, dominated by mostly Hindu Meiteis, account for just over 11 per cent of the area, but are home to 57 per cent of the state’s 2.8 million population (2011 Census). The hill districts, dominated by mostly Christian Naga and Kuki tribes, are home to 43 per cent of the population. On a more granular view, the interim turf—foothills that have been seeing new settlements from both Kukis eager to get closer to the city and Meiteis seeking new living space—forms the real theatre of conflict now, zones of overlap rife with potential for tension.
But perceptually, the geographical binary is strong. The hill tribes claim Meiteis corner developmental works as they enjoy political might; the latter allege they are being increasingly marginalised in their ancestral land. The Meiteis, who comprised 59 per cent of the population in 1951, now make up 44 per cent, as per the 2011 Census. Though they are politically dominant, they are gradually losing their dominance in the administration. “The number of Kukis in the central and state civil services is very high. Many believe the ST quota has made it easy for them to crack competitive exams,” says a senior IAS officer.
Another irritant for the Meiteis is the Manipur Land Revenue Act, 1960, which bars non-tribals from the valley from buying hill land. The tribals, though, can buy land in the valley. Because the Act is protected under Article 371C of the Constitution, the state assembly cannot alter this provision without consulting the Hill Areas Committee. “At the root of the divide is this invented topographical dichotomy. The ethnic division was accentuated by introducing a division of the land through legislation,” says Prof. A. Bimol Akoijam of Jawaharlal Nehru University. Tribal status for Meiteis will enable them to buy land in the hills. Kuki voices claim it’s a myth that Meiteis cannot do so already. “Otherwise, how come so many Meiteis have homes in hill areas? My Meitei friend from childhood still has her home in Churachandpur,” says Hoineilhing Sitlhou, a Kuki, who teaches at the University of Hyderabad. Sominthang Doungel, leader of the Kuki Inpi Manipur (KIM), says though Section 158 of the Manipur Land Revenue and Land Reforms Act, 1960, restricts non-tribals from directly purchasing tribal land, they can do so with the consent of district councils.
The other trigger: the Biren Singh regime’s drive against encroachers and poppy cultivators in reserved forests. The evictions stem from a November 2022 forest department notification derecognising 38 villages in Churachandpur and Noney districts, which were allegedly located inside the Churachandpur-Khoupum protected forest. The Kukis claim even legitimate residents were evicted. Manipur shares a 400-km border with Myanmar, less than 10 per cent of which is fenced—a natural sieve for drug smuggling. Since 2017, when the BJP came to power, large tracts of poppy fields have been destroyed and alleged encroachers evicted from reserved forests. Most villages affected by this drive are Kuki. This has also resulted in racial stereotyping. “My Meitei friend, who teaches at a university, has written that Kukis are poppy cultivators and illegal immigrants. This is so hurtful. She erased all our childhood memories in one sweeping statement,” says Sitlhou.
The ‘illegal immigrant’ taunt is another bequest of the porous border. Many Myanmar refugees belonging to the Kuki-Chin-Zomi-Mizo ethnic continuum, sharing origins with several hill tribes of Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, had fled to these states following counterinsurgency operations by the junta there. Due to this, claim Meitei groups, new villages emerged in reserved forests. A government source claims 996 new villages have come up in three Kuki-dominated districts—Tengnoupal, Chandel and Churachandpur—since 2006. This hardened anti-Kuki sentiment, with Meitei groups demanding a population commission and the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). They cite an unnatural population boom in the hills where the decadal growth rate in the 2011 Census was recorded as 40 per cent, as against a mere 16 per cent in the valley. The CM too has publicly blamed “Myanmar immigrants” for the deforestation and drug menace. He even formed a cabinet sub-committee to detect illegal immigrants—interestingly, it is headed by tribal affairs minister Letpao Haokip, a Kuki.
Religion further bedevils the situation. The spread of Christianity is resented by Meiteis, who claim missionaries have converted a section of their brethren. Between 1961 and 2011, the share of Hindus in the state declined from 62 per cent to 41 per cent, while Christians rose from 19 per cent to 41 per cent. The conflict has so far seen 221 churches and 17 temples razed. Observers, however, say few Kuki churches were targeted. “More than 150 of these were Meitei churches. It’s a response against increasing Christianisation in rural areasâ€ædisrupting traditional Meitei culture,” says Prof. Oinam.
Biren Singh’s return to power last year was attributed to, inter alia, his outreach programme ‘Go to Hills’—aimed at delivering welfare schemes to hill areas. Even so, there has been no dearth of efforts to replace him. In April, several BJP MLAs, most of them Kuki, arrived in Delhi, exhorting the central leadership to replace the CM. Four BJP legislators also quit in April. The CM’s handling of the current situation—which his detractors claim favours the Meiteis—has hardly been exemplary, but it has consolidated his position as the No. 1 Meitei leader. Though many have demanded his ouster, the BJP can’t afford to be at a disadvantage in 40 valley seats.
For now, the BJP’s top priority is bringing peace back. It’s an uphill task, says a senior army officer, for mistrust between the two sides is complete and all channels of commun­ication have broken down. Sitlhou says some form of separate administration is the only way forward. “I can’t go back to Imphal without feeling unsafe. Many of my Kuki friends cannot imagine living next to Meiteis again,” she says. (The Centre rules out any such move.) Prof. Oinam believes peace depends on how early the communities can sit down for talks. “Let there be dialogue. Both sides are aggressors and victims. It’s important to hear each other out. Half the problems will be solved once we start listening,” he says. Social and political leaders must initiate this listening process.
