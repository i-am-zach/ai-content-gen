In Uttar Pradesh, a lot can change in a place depending on whom it shares history with. Mulayam Singh Yadav bestowed upon his Saifai village sports stadiums, a medical college and a VVIP airstrip, while for Mayawati’s Badalpur village, her victory in the 2007 election meant 24-hour power supply, up from the meagre seven to eight hours of electricity it had to make do with earlier, though things reverted to what they were when she lost power. Now, there’s Gorakhpur, which for years had nothing but squalid lanes, crumbling infrastructure and mafia raj—until a certain monk from the Gorakhnath Math rose to become the chief minister in 2017. It wasn’t long before Gorakhpur became Yogi Adityanath’s grand undertaking. Drive in from the Lucknow highway today, and you will encounter dozens of bulldozers and excavators, all intent on changing the face of the city. From a metro rail network to a sports complex, a network of highways, a film city and massive industrial investment, Gorakhpur stands on the threshold of a spanking new future under the Yogi Adityanath regime.
“Once infamous for its mosquitos and mafia, Gorakhpur is now known for development,” the chief minister said in August last year while laying the foundation of several projects in the city. The city has been put on the fast track to industrialisation, a process set in motion perhaps as soon as the Gorakhpur Industrial Development Authority (GIDA), which operated out of a rented space for nearly 28 years, got a multi-storeyed office within months of Yogi being elected as chief minister. It also has six industrial sectors today, double the number it had in 2017.
“Almost 800 acres of land has been acquired for industries in the past five years,” says GIDA CEO Pavan Agarwal. “We are allotting it to various industries.... We are developing industrial areas around the Gorakhpur Link Expressway and also around the Gorakhpur-Lucknow highway.” There are also plans to set up a new 6,000-acre satellite town called ‘New Gorakhpur’, which will have residential as well as commercial complexes. Other new townships are in the pipeline too.
The infrastructure push is attracting business. Or at least the intent. At the Uttar Pradesh Global Investors Summit held in Lucknow in February this year, Gorakhpur attracted investment worth Rs 1.7 lakh crore, in fourth position after Gautam Buddh Nagar, Agra and Lucknow. Key projects include a proposed LPG pipeline worth Rs 1,800 crore by the Indian Oil Corporation, the RG Strategy Group’s Rs 2,935 crore funding for a paper mill project, Rs 1,200 crore committed by Keyaan Distilleries, and Rs 1,100 crore by Varun Beverages, a subsidiary of PepsiCo. Tatva Plastics, CP Milks and India Glycol Limited are a few other key investors. Also on the cards is a ‘plastic park’, one of Yogi’s dream projects, which is expected to come up at a cost of Rs 93 crore. Spread over 50 acres, it will house around a hundred units that will be involved in a range of plastic processing ventures from supply to recycling. Five acres under the project have been earmarked for the Central Institute of Petrochemicals Engineering and Technology to set up a testing laboratory.
In addition to these projects, the Gorakhpur fertiliser plant, which had to be shut down in 1990 due to an ammonia gas leak that claimed an employee’s life, has also been restarted at a cost of nearly Rs 8,600 crore. Separately, Avada Ventures, which participated in the investors’ summit in February, has signed an MoU to commit Rs 22,500 crore for setting up a green ammonia plant in the city.

“Gorakhpur is now becoming a hub for industries in Purvanchal,” says Agarwal. “We are getting new investments. Several units have been started. From next year, our ambitious project, the plastic park, will be functional. We are also allotting plots in flatted factories [small units located in multi-storeyed buildings] mainly for garments manufacturing work.”
Not just Gorakhpur’s industrial status, its civic identity too is getting an upgrade. In just the first year of Yogi’s second term, the city bagged development funding worth Rs 12,000 crore, a big share of which went towards infrastructural revamping. “Gorakhpur’s infrastructure development is in full swing. We are planning several new townships, a sports city and a new convention centreâ€æ. The CM’s vision plays an important role in it,” says Mahendra Singh Tanwar, vice-chairman of the Gorakhpur Development Authority (GDA).

One of the most remarkable transformations is that of the Ramgarh Tal, earlier known as ‘khooni nalla’ thanks to its grisly reputation as being a hotspot of criminal activities. Today, the lakeside has been turned into a beautiful promenade, where the city’s residents can take a stroll, go for boat rides, or eat snacks at the kiosks. CCTV cameras ensure safety; the area also has a four-lane road for motorists, benches for senior citizens, not to mention pretty fountains and tree cover.
Connectivity is another area of prime focus. With more four- and six-lane highways coming up and the 91.3-km Gorakhpur Link Expressway that will connect the city to the Purvanchal Expressway, travel to neighbouring districts will get easier. Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi flagged off the Gorakhpur-Lucknow Vande Bharat train. By 2024, the city is slated to have a two-corridor metro rail network with 27 stations, connecting key areas such as the BRD Medical College, the Gorakhpur railway station, the Gorakhnath Math, the Gorakhpur University and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The AIIMS, in fact, was set up in 2016, but became operational only in 2019 after its outpatient department was launched that year and the institute started its first MBBS batch with 50 students. Spread across nearly 100 acres, the institute has turned Gorakhpur into the health capital of eastern UP, catering to people from areas such as Maharajganj, Deoria, Basti Kushinagar, and Azamgarh.
Gorakhpur is also looking forward to the 100-acre regional film city that actor and Gorakhpur MP Ravi Kishan announced last year. “The aim is to ensure that local youth can pursue their dreams here instead of leaving for Bombay,” he had said. “UP has immense talent, they need a platform. If they get employment here, why would they struggle in Bombay?” Several Bhojpuri production houses have begun work too. On the culture and tourism front, while the famous Gorakhnath temple has been renovated, several big hotel chains such as the Taj Vivanta, Ramada, Holiday Inn and Marriott are already in the process of setting up shop in the city.
The changed fortunes of their city have the locals excited. Himanshu Kamlapuri, an entrepreneur here, is all praise for the government’s efforts. However, he wants it to focus on small businesses as well. “Apart from big industries, the government should focus on the welfare of local businessmen, upcoming industries should be encouraged to tie up with them,” he says. His brother Simant, an engineering student, is equally optimistic. “Gorakhpur has changed in the past five years,” he says. “You can see new highways, quality roads and an almost 24-hour power supply. I never thought I’d settle here, but now, if I get a job in the upcoming industries, I’d definitely want to.” For a state long scorned as being an economic laggard that exports the largest number of job-seeking migrants, that’s no small vote of confidence.
