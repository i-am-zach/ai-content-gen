Retired bank manager Vimal Rastogi, 70, and his wife always had a place they would go to celebrate special occasions—the banks of the Ganga in Varanasi. Around 15 years ago, though, the visits stopped. Reema got arthritis, and it became impossible for her to use the steep steps on the river’s ghats. But earlier this year, friends and family organised a surprise birthday celebration for her at the spanking new Namo Namah Ghat. Sitting in her wheelchair, Reema performed her beloved Ganga aarti and sought the blessings of the holy river. For people like Reema, the ghat (formerly known as Khidkiya Ghat) has become a boon. It also offers the first glimpse of Kashi if you are coming into Varanasi by train from Mughalsarai (now renamed Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Nagar).
According to government sources, the Namo Namah Ghat is only one of 1,243 new projects commissioned in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency in the past nine years at a cost of Rs 17, 823 crore. While some have been completed, many others are in progress. The PM is expected to visit the city on September 23 (his 42nd trip to the holy city since May 2014 when he first won from here) and will be laying the foundation stone for Purvanchal’s first international cricket stadium, to be built in the Ganjari area. He may also inaugurate the new 5.3 km-long Phulwaria four-lane highway connecting the Babatpur airport to the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) campus here.
Currently, projects worth Rs 11,842 crore are under way (see A Few Big Plans), including a Rs 645 crore cable car ropeway. The 3.75 km ropeway will connect the Cantonment railway station to Godowlia Chowk with stops at the Kashi Corridor, the Kashi Vishwanath temple and Dashashwamedh Ghat. When it opens in 2025, it is expected to carry at least 30,000 passengers a day. Ramesh Gupta, who runs a puja samagri (material) store in Godowlia, says, “The ropeway should ease matters considerably. Right now, it takes one and a half hours to go from Godowlia to the Cantt station during the day, which is why traders prefer to pick up stock after midnight.”
Baba Radheshyam, who stays next to the Hanuman temple behind Assi Ghat, says everything has changed since Modi chose Varanasi as his constituency. “The restoration of the ghats and temples aside, the place is no longer dingy and filthyâ€æthere are lights everywhere,” he says. Indeed, the PM’s mission of Swachh Varanasi began soon after he first took charge. His visit to the temple town on November 8, 2014, became memorable for the photo-op of Modi sweeping Assi Ghat. Nearly nine years later, Varanasi’s 84 ghats have all been refurbished—they are now lit up at night (a project that cost Rs 20 crore), the major ones have amenities, including toilets, changing rooms, police posts and tourist centres. A pedestrian walkway also winds down from Godowlia Chowk to Dashashwamedh Ghat.
The Namo Namah ghat, which skirts the Ganga’s banks for half a kilometre, has been transformed under the Smart City Mission. Spread across 21,000 sq. metres, its most striking feature is the 25 ft-tall hand sculptures. It also boasts an open air theatre, food court, children’s park, free wi-fi and ‘India’s first floating CNG filling station’. An immersion pool, water sports area and helipad are next on the agenda.
Prof. G.C. Tripathi, former vice-chancellor of BHU, divides the redevelopment of Varanasi into two phases. “The first was between 2014 and 2017 with the Modi government at the Centre and the Samajwadi Party (SP) in power in Uttar Pradesh. The second phase began in 2017, when the Yogi Adityanath government took charge and development plans picked up pace,” he says.
Like the Deepotsav held on Chhoti Deepavali in Ayodhya, Yogi started the tradition of holding a grand Dev Deepavali on Varanasi’s ghats on the night of Kartik Purnima. Modi himself participated in the Dev Deepavali of November 2020, the highlight of which was the lighting of 1.5 million diyas (oil lamps) on the ghats, even though it was in the middle of the Covid-19 crisis. “The Dev Deepavali celebrations attracted a new category of tourists and, with the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, Varanasi’s potential as a tourist destination exploded,” Tripathi adds.

Religious tourism has really kicked off in Varanasi. This year, a record 16.3 million devotees visited Kashi Vishwanath Dham in the month of saavan, which ended on August 31, the first time it has crossed the 10 million figure. Sunil Verma, CEO of the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Trust, says, “Since the inauguration of the Kashi Vishwanath Dham in December 2021, close to 100 million devotees have visited the place.” Among the new facilities coming up for the comfort of the devotees is a hangar to protect them from the heat and golf carts to ferry them around. The Manikarnika and Harishchandra ghats, located next to the Kashi Vishwanath Dham, are also getting a Rs 15 crore facelift under the Namami Gange project. As D. Vasudevan, the chief general manager of the Smart City Mission in Varanasi, explains, “Eight new ghats will enhance the crescent-shaped pattern of the Uttar Vahini Ganga.” The holy city has 93 ghats now, including Namo Ghat and eight other new ones.
Another thing Varanasi has going for it is Kaushal Raj Sharma, the commissioner of the Varanasi division. Appointed the district magistrate of Varanasi in November 2019, Sharma was felicitated by PM Modi for topping the Pradhan Mantri Swanidhi Yojana (micro credit and digitisation scheme) in 2021. On July 29 last year, the state government transferred Sharma to Prayagraj, but the order was rescinded within 24 hours after the PMO intervened.
Sharma has been entrusted with the responsibility of completing all the projects under way before the 2024 Lok Sabha election. “The prime minister has introduced a unique development model for temple towns through Varanasi. Develop a religious/ cultural city in a way that it changes the economy of the region and the lives of all the people there,” he says.
The results are already beginning to show. According to the Varanasi tourism department, 71.1 million domestic and 83,741 foreign tourists visited the temple town in 2022, which is 15 times the number compared to 2014. Gokul Sharma of the Banaras Hotel Association says, “Kashi Vishwanath Dham has proved to be a jackpot for the tourism industry. Due to the good connectivity with other cities, we get at least 100,000 tourists every day.”
As a result, tourism-dependent businesses in Kashi have seen a huge boom. Santosh Kumar, a member of the Varanasi Tourism Guild, says, “Ten years ago, the Taj Ganges was the only famous hotel in Varanasi. Now, we have a dozen new hotels in this category. Right now, there are more than 2,500 big and small hotels in Varanasi.” Even so, there is a scramble for hotel rooms “even in the off-season” (April-September). The Babatpur airport now gets some 60 flights daily. Says Sharma, “The Babatpur airport is being expanded at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore. The air strip will be made longer and wider, so that even wide-bodied aircraft like the Airbus A380 can land here.”
Not everyone is happy with this mad rush of tourists, though. Siyaram Yadav, owner of the famous Yadav Hotel in Dhausabad area who had a moment in the spotlight with his ‘Modi roti’ in 2014, says, “The tourist influx has led to heavy traffic on the roads leading to the Kashi Vishwanath Dham. Varanasi’s narrow roads have added to the mess, and there are traffic jams on these routes all the time now. The businesses in these areas have slowed down.”
To deal with the traffic jam and the safety of tourists, a police commissionerate has been set up in Varanasi. Sharma says, “Road-widening work is going on in the city on a large scale. A total of five roads, including the roads coming from Mughalsarai, Ghazipur and Azamgarh towards Varanasi, are being converted into six-laned ones. New parking areas have been created at four places in the city. All the traffic now coming from south of Varanasi will be able to go towards Babatpur airport without entering the city.” Being Modi’s parliamentary constituency also means there is a constant stream of ministers and officers from the Centre and state government descending on the city, which, critics say, has added to the vehicular chaos.
The prime minister’s visit this time around could see schemes worth another Rs 2,000 crore being inaugurated. Government sources say this is just the prelude, the frequency of the PM’s visits to the holy city are only likely to increase as the 2024 general election approaches.
