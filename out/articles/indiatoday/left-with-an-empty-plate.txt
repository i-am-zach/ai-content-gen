Over the past several years, the Trinamool Congress government in West Bengal has been buffeted by a series of corruption allegations that have tarnished its reputation: from the teachers’ recruitment scandal to the cow smuggling scam, from the coal imbroglio to cases of extortion by its leaders. Now, a slew of new charges have come up against the ruling party—that of siphoning off funds and rations from the Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman or PM-Poshan scheme (earlier called the Mid-Day Meal Scheme) for children towards other party and governance needs. Into the mix are dishonest busi­ness­men, a pliant administration and a dubious alliance between private and government schools. The irregularities, if proved, could be a new low for the state government.
The matter came to light when the West Bengal chapter of the ‘Right to Food’ campaign—an independent network of organisations working towards ensuring food security—conducted extensive research based on data provided by the state, unearthing a shortfall in the quantity of mid-day meal rations supplied during the pandemic lockdown between April 2020 and June 2022. The dep­rivation faced by 11.5 million children (the total number of primary and upper primary schoolgoing children in the state) was qua­­ntified at 45,593 tonnes of rice. In terms of proteins—mainly provided through vegetables and lentils—each child was deprived of roughly 7 kilos, says the report. The monetary value of the leakage is pegged to be Rs 1,572 crore, which the children were entitled to as part of the scheme.
While the research findings, which hint at an unc­on­­scionable offence, have startled many, the whole issue has a particularly bad odour because the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 (2019-21) reveals that 34 per cent of Bengal’s children under the age of five are short for their age or are ‘stunted’, 20 per cent are too thin or ‘wasted’, seven per cent are ‘severely wasted’ and 32 per cent are ‘underweight’. Worse, these latest figures are distinctly higher in every category from those in NFHS-4 (2015-16). Rights activist Anuradha Talwar, who spearheaded the campaign, says: “NFHS-5 shows high levels of malnutrition among schoolgoing children in Bengal. Hunger is an inevitable part of the lives of children from deprived backgrounds. The school’s hot meal is a small relief. But the drop in this during the pandemic impacted their nutrition and it will show up in NFHS-6.”
The BJP has also raised red flags, with leader of the opposition Suvendu Adhikari writing to Union HRD minister Dharmendra Pradhan in January about the “biggest ongoing financial scam involving systematic misappropriation and diversion of PM Poshan funds”. In his letter, he has provided documents showing how the BDO of Hingalgunj in North 24 Parganas district allegedly diverted Rs 16.25 lakh from mid-day meal funds on account of refreshments for an admi­nistrative visit by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on November 29 and December 1, 2022. Adhikari’s letter alleges that funds were being diverted for administrative purposes for over a decade.
Reacting to the letter, and to consistent reports of poor quality food being served in Bengal, the Centre sent teams comprising Union education ministry officials and nutritionists in early February to various parts of the state for a review. The team is yet to disclose its findings.
TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh rubbi­shed all claims and dubbed it as vendetta politics. He said, “The state government is implementing the mid-day meal scheme in the best possible way des­p­ite a severe financial crunch, as the Centre has stopped funds.... Ins­tead of accusing us, he (Adhikari) should ask his political bosses to release funds.” Minister of women and child development Shashi Panja says, “I hope the research is unbiased. We haven’t got any report. If they had been genuinely concerned, they would have visited other states instead of sending central teams to Bengal. The defaming of our state is our main concern.”
According to the PM Poshan Sch­eme, the cost of one daily hot meal is slated to be Rs 5.45 for each primary child (one- to five-year-olds) and Rs 7.97 for each upper primary child (six- to eight-year-olds). This excludes the cost of foodgrains (rice or wheat) that primary and upper primary children—100 gm and 150 gm, respectively—are ent­itled to and the cooking cost. The foodgrains are supplied free of cost by the Food Corporation of India (FCI). The purpose of the scheme is to meet the nutritional standards of children and to guard against diseases like anaemia and stu­­nted growth. With daily allotment per child pegged at Rs 5.45/ Rs 7.97 and the number of school days at 220-240 a year, a lot of money is concentrated in the Poshan scheme for 11.5 million children in Bengal.

The modus operandi
According to many teachers india today spoke to, many schools allegedly inflate the number of the scheme’s beneficiaries to divert funds, since it is based on a head count of children eating the meals. The most common practice is to show that 100 per cent of students entitled to the meal are eating it regularly, which is never actually the case. For instance, at a primary school in West Midnapore on February 17, only 40 out of 92 students attended classes. Ideally, the school should provide a true average picture of students eating meals. But this never happens. Instead, schools demand a full share of funds. This is also a way to use the rice/ wheat left in stock elsewhere.
There are other means to show a full utilisation of the mid-day meal. There has been a proliferation of private primary schools in Bengal’s semi-urban areas, who are hand-in-glove with government schools. “Sabang block (in West Midnapore) has six private kindergarten schools with 150 students each. Parents admit their children to private primary schools, but want them to join government schools in higher classes—either because private ones have no secondary classes or are quite expensive. So a tacit understanding is arrived at—private schools allow government primary schools to show their students on records, so as to inflate their student strength and help them claim full Poshan funds. In exchange, they are assured that their students would get abs­orbed in government schools later,” alleges Sabang BJP leader Amulya Maity.
A primary school teacher in Hingal­gunj says, “There’s a school here that has about 10 students. How does it function? Private primary schools lend them students. On average, 50 to 100 private school students make it to the government portal.” Indeed, despite the state government’s digital Banglar Shiksha portal maintaining data of each government school along with individual students, the practice continues. Teachers claim that the portal uploads whatever information a school provides, with no one to examine its veracity. School inspectors empowered to visit and verify information, including about mid-day meals, mostly depend on school data. Again, many government schools have opened hostels, where mid-day meal rati­ons are allegedly used to feed hostel inmates even if they aren’t covered under Poshan.
Then there are ration dealers/ dis­tri­­­butors who have lifted a large stock of foodgrains for the scheme from the FCI. A senior bureaucrat says they keep aside a portion under the authorities’ instruction. They also allegedly send a rice consignment three to four months in advance to schools so that parts are damaged, face complaint, and branded inedible. The dealer then takes back the entire stock, though much of it is in good condition. He either sells it in the open market or allegedly supplies it to ruling party leaders. When informed, FCI replenishes the whole stock. “This is a prevalent practice during the monsoon, when dealers push ration for three months at a go, knowing well the risk of flooding,” says a headmaster of a school in Andul, in Howrah district.
Besides, there are widespread alle­gations that BDOs withhold mid-day meal funds for a month or two. Opposition parties like the BJP and CPI(M) allege this is done to enjoy the extra bank interest that accrues.
According to Talwar, the Poshan scheme in Bengal was worst hit during Covid. “During the lockdowns, when families faced starvation, children nee­­ded nutrition. But we found children in Bengal getting two kilos of rice and two kilos of potatoes a month, which was much below their entitlement,” she says.
Going by such hard nutritional facts, the PM Poshan scheme in West Bengal needs to be put back on track. Else, its youngest generations may be pushed towards mass malnutrition.
