In June 2022, Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde, who was the urban development minister in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by his party president Uddhav Thackeray, sprung a surprise by walking out with 39 other Sena legislators. He later became the chief minister in a coalition government with the BJP. Ten months later, there is speculation whether the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is part of the MVA’s rainbow coalition, may see another ‘Shinde’ emerge from its ranks.
A series of statements by the NCP and MVA leadership fuelled rumours implying that a section of the NCP led by Pawar’s nephew Ajit Pawar, who is the leader of the Opposition in the state legislative assembly, may rebel and join hands with the BJP to evade action by the central investigation agencies. NCP leaders have heavy stakes in the state’s cooperative sector, including many sugar factories and banks.
However, there are indications that a truce may have been struck for now. On April 18, Ajit, who was the deputy chief minister in the MVA government, strongly denied reports that he had secured the support of 40 of 53 NCP MLAs in his bid. “We all belong to the NCP and will continue in the NCPâ€æ we will work for the party till we are alive,” he claimed. But then went on to add a loaded caveat: “Any decision that will be taken about this (a change in political affiliations) will be done as a party. But now, the party has decided to strengthen the MVA.” His uncle—seen as an architect and trouble-shooter of the MVA—too dismissed any reports about Ajit breaking ranks.
Despite these sanctimonious denials, a cloud of suspicion continues to linger over the NCP’s future course of action, largely due to a series of statements by the Pawar duo. For instance, while opposition parties took an aggressive position in Parliament seeking a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into the allegations against the Adani Group, Pawar opposed this demand. He, however, softened his stance later. On the very day (April 7) that his uncle made this statement, Ajit went incommunicado. While it was widely speculated that he may have met BJP leaders during this period, Ajit later attributed his absence to a bout of acidity. The two Pawars have taken positions defending Modi after the opposition sought details about his educational qualifications. While opposition parties, including the NCP, have raised doubts about the alleged tampering of EVMs, Ajit virtually gave the machines a clean chit. This has led some senior Congress leaders to claim that this was a way of trying to warm up to the BJP and “recalibrate” their relationship.
Much of these speculations can be attributed to lingering questions over what happened behind the scenes during Ajit’s brief palace coup in 2019. He had joined hands with the BJP in a shortlived arrangement that preceded the formation of the MVA government.

These conjectures reached a crescendo after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) did not name Ajit and his wife Sunetra in a chargesheet in a case about the auction of a sugar mill in Satara at an undervalued price by the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank (MSCB) when he was on its board. On his part, Ajit said that the ED had not given him a clean chit and a probe was underway.
The Supreme Court has finished hearing a bunch of petitions on the change of guard in Maharashtra. If Shinde and 15 of his MLAs are disqualified under the provisions of the anti-defection law, the BJP may need more numbers to shore up support in the legislature. But while Ajit has dismissed any reports about his impending tie-up with the BJP or about any meeting with senior BJP leaders, at least two NCP MLAs—Manikrao Kokate and Anna Bansode—have said in public that they will support Ajit’s decision.

After Ajit went public with his den­ial, a senior Congress leader said that any coup may have been put off for now due to the reluctance of the BJP leadership considering the Karnataka polls and the impending SC verdict. Unease in the Shinde camp may have also led to a rethink. Sanjay Shirsat, MLA and spo­kesperson of the Shinde-led Shiv Sena, said that they would welcome Ajit if he joined them, but warned that they were not willing to participate in a government which had the NCP as a partner.
Earlier, the tremors of these developments were felt in the MVA. Thackeray and his Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut met Pawar Senior and his daughter Supriya Sule, the Lok Sabha MP from Baramati, at Pawar’s Mumbai home. On April 16, Raut in his weekly column in party mouthpiece Saamana wrote that the BJP was trying to use agencies like the ED to break the NCP. During the meeting, he elaborated, Pawar said “no one wants to leave by their free will, but the family is being targeted”. Raut said Pawar had assured them that even if some from the NCP left in their individual capacity, the party would never align with the BJP. Thackeray and his men have claimed that their legislators joined Shinde’s coup to evade the heat from the enforcement agencies. Former CM and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan has said that the ruling coalition is making attempts to break the MVA and launch its ‘Operation Kamal’ to engineer defections in the opposition.
Speaking to a Marathi news channel earlier, Pawar, when asked about Ajit’s short-lived dalliance with the BJP and whether it could be repeated, had said: “It cannot be said today what position someone will take tomorrow.” A senior leader of the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) admits to a churn within the NCP, with some leaders eager to join hands with the BJP, but says that Pawar Senior is “firmly with the MVA”. This is corroborated by one of his party colleagues with roots in the NCP. “The course of events will be based on how these currents and counter-currents play out,” he notes. This leader says that Pawar may have defended Adani Group chairperson Gautam Adani at a personal level rather than a political one. Hence, political motives must not be read into it, he adds.
In his autobiography, Lok Majhe Sangati... (2015), Pawar writes glowingly about Adani and calls him a hard-working, self-made and grounded man. Pawar says while Adani got into the business of providing coal for thermal power projects, he (Pawar) suggested that he could also take to developing power projects. Adani Power has also developed a 3,300 MW thermal power plant in Gondia, which is the base of senior NCP leader Praful Patel.
Two senior BJP leaders confirm that back-channel talks with NCP leaders are underway. “This is why the expansion of the state cabinet has been put off for longâ€æ But contrary to speculation, any defections from the NCP will not take place with an eye on the likely SC verdict. This is being done to ensure more seats in our kitty from Maharashtra in the Lok Sabha polls as our party’s central leadership is focused on ensuring a good showing nationally,” claims one leader. The other BJP leader says some developments are likely to take place before the Lok Sabha election. “They are willing to join us anytime, but we will give them the signal at the right moment,” he maintains. When contacted by india today, Sule said: “I have absolutely no knowledge of it.”
A senior Congress leader from western Maharashtra, where the NCP also has a base, says instead of playing a secondary role in an alliance with the BJP, Ajit also seems to be exploring the option of continuing with the MVA in the hope that the NCP will emerge as the single-largest party in the assembly polls next year. This may help him make a bid for the CM’s post, a job that eluded him in 2004 despite the NCP having 71 seats—two more than those won by their ally, the Congress. At that time, it was seen as a move by Pawar to cut his nephew to size.
As a source from the ranks of Thackeray’s Shiv Sena notes, the supporters of the NCP, which has a largely rural and peri-urban base, are pragmatic and may migrate with their leaders to greener pastures. Many leaders from the NCP and Congress, like revenue minister Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil (Congress) and former deputy chief minister Vijaysinh Mohite Patil and his son Ranjitsinh (NCP), have made a successful transition to the BJP over the years.
NCP chief spokesperson Mahesh Tapase has denied any contentions of a split in the party. “In the recent session of the state legislature, Ajit Pawar aggressively played the part of the leader of the Opposition. (Sharad) Pawar Saheb will attend the MVA’s joint rally in Mumbai on May 1. He is also trying to unify the Opposition at the national level (for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls). Ajit Pawar is one of the main generals in this fight (against the BJP),” he says. On his part, deputy chief minister Fadnavis has admitted that some legislators from the Congress and NCP are in touch with them.
The speculations over the NCP’s next moves have also brought 82-year-old Pawar’s politics into focus. Pawar is described as unpredictable even by contemporary political standards. Fadnavis has earlier said that in 2019, the BJP was in power-sharing talks with Pawar himself before his early morning swearing-in with Ajit.
Senior journalist Vijay Chormare, who has covered Pawar’s politics at close quarters, says while a political motive is being attributed to Pawar’s statement on the Adani issue, the ties between Pawar and Adani are decades old. He adds the statements on Modi’s degree, however, have “caused damage to the NCP’s reputation like in 2014, when the party had offered support to the BJP. This was a major blunder, but some calculations must be behind this move.”
According to Chormare, the speculation about Ajit’s course of action arose from the SC’s impending judgment. “Such rumour-mongering is unjust,” he says. However, senior journalist and editor Nikhil Wagle says Ajit could go to the BJP’s side “in whatever form, either as part of the NCP or as a rebel” if he is promised the CM’s position. Pawar Senior “will remain in the opposition alliance and yet help Modi and the BJP as he has always maintained his relations across party lines,” he adds.
As a former Congress minister notes, the hypothesis that the united MVA could pool its strength and take on the Shinde-BJP combine and emerge triumphant had been proven in the bypolls to the Kasba Peth constituency in Pune—a saffron stronghold. Here, Ravindra Dhangekar of the Congress scored a victory over Hemant Rasane of the BJP. “When senior BJP leaders say they have taken a lesson from this defeat, it is obvious they will work to splinter the united opposition,” he says. Whether the NCP and the larger MVA manage to withstand these pressures and stay together may determine the outcome of Maharashtra’s politics in the days to come.
